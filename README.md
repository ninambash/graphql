### GraphQL
 Graphql provides a way for client applications to specify exactly what data they need from an API, and allows the server to respond with only that data.

Unlike traditional RESTful APIs, which often require multiple requests to retrieve all the data needed for an application, GraphQL allows for multiple resources to be fetched in a single request, reducing network overhead and improving performance. It also allows clients to retrieve data in a strongly-typed manner, which can improve the reliability and maintainability of client applications.

In addition to its query language, GraphQL provides a type system that allows developers to define the shape of the data that can be queried, and a mutation system that allows for changes to be made to the data on the server. It is designed to work with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, and has gained significant popularity in recent years as a modern alternative to traditional RESTful APIs.
